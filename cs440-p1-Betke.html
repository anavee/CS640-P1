<h3>Problem Definition</h3>
The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a program that recognizes at least three different gestures of a person in front of a web camera.
The program is to be fed videos from webcams and at each frame, it should output a score for each gesture that describes how likely a particular gesture is at this time.

<h3>Method & Implementation</h3>
Give a concise description of the implemented method. For example, you might describe the motivation of current idea, the algorithmic steps or any formulation used in current method.
Please specify the main functions you created for this assignment and explain their uses shortly. For instance:
"TemplateMatch": perform exhaustive searching the template matched sub-image in given object scene image for every pixel position
"CalcCorrCoef": calculate the normalized correlation coefficient value for current sub-image and template image

<h3>Experimental Results</h3>
List your experimental results here. Make sure the relevant parameter values are specified with the corresponding results. For instance:

<h3>Discussion & Conclusion</h3>
Answer the questions given for current programming assignment in a clear way. Even though it is not mandatory, you are welcome to conclude the current method in this section in your own point of view. For example, you might want to point out the limitations and potential improvements for current methods in practical applications.

 

Finally, do not forget to add credits for any person you have discussed with. If you have used any resource of codes not specified in the class, please have a reference to them here. For instance:

 

  Thank Jingbin Wang for helpful discussions.

<h3>Analysis of Results</h3>
<h4>How often was your program able to correctly identify an activity (number of true positive detections)?</h4>
<h4>How often did your program miss detecting an activity (number of false negative detections)?</h4>
<h4>How often did your program misinterpret an activity (number of false positive detections)?</h4>
<h4>What were the difficulties in recognizing activities?</h4>
<h4>Potential future work. What would you try (if you had more time) to overcome the failures/limitations of your work?</h4>
