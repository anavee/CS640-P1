            The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a program that recognizes
            at least three different gestures of a person in front of a web camera. The program
            is to be fed videos from webcams and at each frame, it should output a score for
            each gesture that describes how likely a particular gesture is at this time.

            Method & Implementation</div>
        <p>
            The program grabs frames from the webcam and applies temporal differencing to sense
            motions in the frames. From these processed frames a binary image is produced where
            black denotes no motion and white denotes a moving object. Using image moments,
            the tracked object's centroid, L1, L2 and theta are calculated. This image moment
            information is passed to an object tracker and motion analyzer to track and interpret
            the image. The object tracker creates a rectangle with similar moments based on
            the image moment and displays that to the user. The motion analyzer then collects
            a series of image moments and calculates a trajectory of the movement to determine
            what gesture is taking place with a certain confidence. If the confidence meets
            a 70% reliability then the result is printed to a console with the confidence.
        </p>
        Techniques used:

            <div id="heading4">
                Temporal differencing</div>
            <p>
                The temporal difference processor takes two <code>CS440Image</code>s and generates
                a composite image. To produce the composite, the processor iterates over the corresponding
                pixels in the two argument images and sets the composite pixel to be the absolute
                difference between the red, green and blue color bands in the source images.
            </p>
            <p>
                The temporal difference processor can be configured to average difference images
                over a configurable window. While we had initially planned on using these average
                difference images to perform recognition, in practice this turned out to be not
                as effective as hoped. In our final configuration, we reduced the window size to
                just two and used the difference images directly.
            </p>
            <div id="heading4">
                Image Moments</div>
            <p>
                The image moments generator takes a <code>CS440Image</code> that has been converted
                to a temporal difference image by the temporal difference processor. The moments
                generator calculates the M00, M10, M01, M11, M02, and M20 moments using the formulas
                provided in class. With the M values calculated the generator then calculates the
                centroid (x, y), the height and width of the area in L1 and L2, and the theta angle
                of the rectangle.
            </p>
            <p>
                The image moments generator can be configured with a threshold value for the intensity.
                Due too a high sensitivity in motion detection a threshold value was instituted
                that is compared to the sum of the RGB value to determine if the pixel color is
                close to white. Doing this removes noise from the temporal difference image so that
                it focuses on the objects that are moving.
            </p>
            <div id="heading4">
                Motion Analysis</div>
            <p>
                The system aggregates the calculated image moments in order to deduce the direction
                and velocity of the object being captured. It works by collecting a configurable
                number of image moments and then producing difference vectors from the centroids
                of time-adjacent moments. The angle and magnitude of these difference vectors are
                then averaged and if the resulting vector is above a specified velocity threshold,
                the direction and confidence of the motion is outputted to the results window. The
                confidence value is proportional to the remainder of the averaged difference vector
                angle and pi/2.
            </p>
            <p>
                A more robust solution would probably take magnitude into account when computing
                confidence. It would also be interesting to calculate the average difference vector
                with more emphasis on the most recent measurements, perhaps using an exponential-weighted
                moving average instead of the arithmetic one.

                    Potential future work</div>
<p>There are a number of avenues for improving and expanding on the gesture recognition in this project.  Our recognition system is based entirely on movement; a more full-featured gesture recognition program could incorporate techniques for analyzing still images like an axial-projection histogram for skin tone detection.  Our centroid-based movement detection scheme could also be generalized to do optical flow analysis across the entire image.</p>
<p>In addition, enhancements could be made to increase the robustness of the current functionality.  More time to tune measurement thresholds may have made the results more robust in the face of varying scene characteristics.  The team would have also liked to optimize the performance of the temporal difference processor so larger time windows could have been analyzed.

                Conclusion</div>
	    <p>
	      In general, our group was satisfied with the results we achieved in gesture recognition.  Despite this being the first exposure to these techniques for all team members, our results indicate successful identifications under controlled conditions.  One challenge that became apparent in this work is that the analysis algorithms under consideration were reliable in only a narrow band of the "gesture-space".  Finding gestures that were amenable to classification while implementing the algorithms motivated a number of mid-course corrections and required flexible goal-setting.
